Simplified example implementations of common architectural- and design patterns (including principles like SOLID).

## History

When developing software I've always focused on its behavior and not given the structure much thought. Which of course has led to problems down the road when working on bigger projects with thousands of lines of code. Reading "Clean Architecture - A Craftsmanâ€™s Guide to Software Structure and Design" by Robert Cecil Martin, I realized this and decided to start trying to rectify the situation.

Soon after I started work on this project, which is probably going to be never ending.
